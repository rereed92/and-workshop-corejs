// # Truthy / Falsey

// ## The `!!` operator

// We sometimes see the double exclamation operator

// This simply coerces a value into either true/false, it's useful for turning values such as `undefined` or `null` or empty object into their boolean counterparts, for simplicity. 

// ## What do you think the following will return?

console.log( !!({}) );

console.log( !!([]) );

console.log( !!("true") );

console.log( !!("false") );

console.log( !!("0") );

console.log( !!(1) );

console.log( !!new Boolean(false) );

console.log( !!(undefined) );

console.log( !!(null) );

console.log( !!("") );

console.log( !!(0) );

// **Question:** What's the difference between null and undefined?

// ## Loose, vs strict equality

// **Question:** What are the differences between: 

console.log(0 == "0")
console.log(0 === "0")

// **Question:** What's the difference between `==` and `===`

// **Answer:** `==` is looser about type checking. 
// == Loose quality checking
// === strictly equality checking, checks type as well
// two objects are not equal to each other - checkes to see if they are stored in the same location in memory
// cloned objects will equal each other

// **Question:** So which should you use?

// **Answer:** Always use `===` strict equality â€” just cast the types if you need, be explicit (and test)!
